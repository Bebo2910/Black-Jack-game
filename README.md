### Description

Blackjack, also known as 21, is a popular card game played in casinos around the world. It's a game of skill, strategy, and luck, where the goal is to beat the dealer by having a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. Here's a description of how the game is typically played:

**Objective:**
The primary objective in blackjack is to have a hand value that is higher than the dealer's hand without going over 21. If a player's hand exceeds 21, they lose, regardless of the dealer's hand.

**Card Values:**
- Numbered cards (2-10) are worth their face value.
- Face cards (King, Queen, Jack) are each worth 10 points.
- Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points, depending on which value benefits the player more without exceeding 21.

**Gameplay:**
1. **Initial Deal:** The game begins with the player and the dealer each receiving two cards. The player's cards are usually dealt face up, while one of the dealer's cards is face up (known as the "upcard"), and the other is face down (known as the "hole card").

2. **Player's Turn:** The player has several options:
   - **Hit:** The player can request additional cards ("hits") one at a time to increase their hand value.
   - **Stand:** The player can choose to keep their current hand and end their turn.
   - **Double Down:** In some variations, the player can double their initial bet and receive one more card before being required to stand.
   - **Split:** If the player's initial two cards are of the same rank (e.g., two 7s), they can choose to split them into two separate hands, each with its bet. Additional cards are then dealt to each split hand.

3. **Dealer's Turn:** After the player completes their turn, the dealer reveals their hole card.
   - The dealer must hit until their hand value is 17 or higher. Some variations require the dealer to hit on a "soft 17" (a hand containing an Ace valued as 11).
   - If the dealer's hand exceeds 21, the player wins regardless of their hand value.
   - If the dealer's hand is 21 or less, the player's hand value is compared to the dealer's, and the closest to 21 without going over wins.

4. **Winning and Payouts:**
   - If the player's hand value is closer to 21 than the dealer's without exceeding 21, the player wins.
   - If the player's hand is a blackjack (an Ace and a 10-value card), they typically win with a black jack.
   - Ties result in a "push," and the player's bet is returned.
   - If the player busts (exceeds 21), they lose their bet.
